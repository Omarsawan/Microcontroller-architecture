# Microcontroller-architecture
A simulation of instruction set architecture

The Microarchitecture is simulated to be like harvard architecture that has instruction memory separated from the data memory , and both of them is 1024 x 32 bits .
The Microarchitecture has 32 general purpose registers.
The instruction set is:
  a) Arithmetic Instructions:
    1. Sub.
    2. Add.
    3. Add immediate.
      4. Multiply.
  b) Logical Instructions:
    1. Or.
    2. And immediate.
    3. Shift right logical.
    4. Shift left logical.
  c) Data Transfer Instructions:
    1. Load word.
    2. Store word.
  d) Conditional Branch Instructions:
    1. Branch on equal.
    2. Branch on less than.
  e) Comparison Instructions:
    1. Set on less than immediate.
  f) Unconditional Jump Instructions:
    1. Jump Register.
